### learn from workshop 0

- Made a p5.js sketch using 2D primitive shape of circle.
- Variables: x = x + 4, moving shape across the canvas.
- Conditionals: if(x < width){ x = 0;}, shape coming back.

### things that I explore

- Explored RGB colors.(icecream flavor, icecream cone)
- Change of setup: color of background.

Conditionals: when the shape get to beyond halfway, it becomes red.
if (x > width / 2) {
    fill(255, 0, 0);
  } else {
    stroke(0);
  fill(152, 255, 152);
  }
